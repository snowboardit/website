I’m a full-stack software engineer with a backend focus, based in Maine. I specialize in building high performance, secure, and scalable systems with Go, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and have additional experience in Redis, Docker, NATS.io, and AWS.

At [Defendify](https://defendify.com), I work across 25+ repositories - designing backend systems, improving performance, and enhancing user experiences. My projects range from refactoring customer-facing pages for faster load times to building authentication systems that strengthen security. I’ve also contributed to open-source tools like [slack-go/slack](https://github.com/slack-go/slack).

With a background in IT and audio/video engineering, I bring a practical, results-driven approach to software development. I’m passionate about clean architecture, the Unix philosophy, and solving real-world problems through thoughtful, simple, and maintainable code.

Outside of work, I serve as a board member and webmaster for the [Franconia Soaring Foundation](https://soarfranconia.org/), help others experience the thrill of flight, and spend time on our small farm in Maine with my wife, our greyhounds, cats, and horses. I love to tinker and get my hands dirty - whether it’s working on cars, ATVs, and mowers, woodworking, taking things apart and fixing them, or cultivating crops in our garden.
