I'm a software engineer and tech enthusiast based in Maine, where my wife, a data scientist, and I share a small rustic farm with our beloved greyhound, two curious cats, and a pair of horses. By day, you'll typically find me immersed in code, moving between programming languages and frameworks, crafting intuitive web applications, and tackling intriguing technical challenges at [Defendify](https://defendify.com).

Life isn't only about technology for me - I deeply value balance and staying curious. There's always a new hobby to explore or an old passion to revisit. Recently, I rekindled my love for soccer after a decade away and discovered joy in woodworking; a custom bed for our greyhound is my latest creation.

I'm also passionate about aviation and volunteer with a non-profit aviation foundation, [Franconia Soaring Foundation](https://soarfranconia.org), helping others experience the thrill of flight. When stepping away from screens, I enjoy hands-on projects around our farmâ€”whether that's setting up a new network in the barn or tending to the garden.
